# smart_irrigation_system
The objective of this project is to detect soil moisture
level in the fields and maintain it at an optimum level. Recently,
there has been a sharp decrease in the availability of labour
force in agricultural field and farmers are now heading towards
automated systems. This project is an attempt in the direction
to providing an easy and cost effective solution to automated
irrigation. The data received from soil moisture sensors, coupled
with information of water level in the tanks is used to trigger
the operation of water pump(turning it on or off).
